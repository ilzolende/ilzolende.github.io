      <h1>Alice and Bob</h1>
      <p>Once upon a time, there was a person named Alice. She often traveled between locations by walking.</p>
      <p>Many people in Alice's region did that. One of those people was named Bob.</p>
      <p>One day, when Alice was walking somewhere, she and Bob were going in opposite directions on the same sidewalk. They gave small, impersonal smiles to each other as they walked past each other.</p>
      <p>The end.</p>
