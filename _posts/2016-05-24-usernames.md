GitHub is having a Very Frustrating username issue, which I wish the desktop client would have told me about. I signed into my Ilzo account from the command line and from the desktop client last night, IIRC. Therefore, I *should* have my commits appear under that name.

Ugh.

On a lighter note, this is far easier than Neocities, and I really like it. Can't wait to add the mesolexia content!
