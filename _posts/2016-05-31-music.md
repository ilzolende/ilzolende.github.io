I spoke with the local Reform rabbi, who said that in his opinion posting recordings of prayers would be fine, and the real issue from a religious standpoint would be _typing_ the text, because the main issue is _erasing_ the name of G-d. I wonder what does and doesn't count for that from a technological standpoint. Would visiting a website containing the name and therefore adding it to and removing it from memory count?
