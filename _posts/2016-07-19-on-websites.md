If you want to have a website for the sake of "having a website", you will probably not create a good website. It usually makes more sense to make some things (which will now be called "content") that you want to put on the internet, and then build a website around this content.

This is both easier and harder than it sounds. People who already have writing that they just want to put online may be happy to know that it's easier than it sounds. At least in my opinion, the only things that you need to do with your set of 3 short stories or what have you before they constitute a good website are these:

- Put them in HTML. Paragraphs go in `<p>` tags, and so on. You may want to also put a title in an `<h1>` tag, and put the whole story in an `<article>` tag.
- Make a navigation system (this can just be a homepage full of links), listing all the short stories or what have you on your website.
- Make sure each content item links back to the navigation system somehow.
- Use CSS styling to put a maximum width on your content, and center it.

This is more complicated if your content is images, or something, but it still shouldn't be that hard. *My* website has many unnecessary features you need not mimic, such as:

- Background wallpaper
- Custom colors
- Custom fonts
- Links to most other main pages on every page
- Another section with a completely separate layout

and more.

An example of website that does not have (much) more formatting than I consider necessary can be found [here](/example-site/index.html).
