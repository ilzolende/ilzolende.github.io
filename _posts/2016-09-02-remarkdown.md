title: Using Remarkdown
---
I'm using remarkdown.css on this website for aesthetic purposes. It's mostly pretty nice.

Minor issues: Formatting my site header was nontrivial. I still can't get the title underline to become bold when in the `:active` or `:focus` states, which matters for mouseless users.

Also, it doesn't do anything to `<cite>` tags, so those are still in italics. I'll need to figure out a convention for formatting titles on my own, I guess.

Another change I've made is using the [asterism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterism_(typography)) ("‚ÅÇ") for `<hr>` tags. It just seems appropriate.
