title: My Experiences With Jekyll, So Far
---
I have, so far, been very happy with Jekyll. The fact that all templates and stylesheets are fully modifiable means that I can create stylistic continuity across my websites.

One issue: I mostly got my CSS to be loaded via mimicking other people's sites until mine worked. I shouldn't encounter that issue again, though.

Also, I don't understand what an `_assets` directory would be for. If I start having lots of media types, I might start using one. Would it be rude to host myself singing? I try to keep the Ogg Vorbis files pretty small. (There's no point in storing low-quality recordings in nearly lossless files.)
