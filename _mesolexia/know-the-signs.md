Most mesolexics will be unable to read even by the age of 5.

If, by age 5, your child still cannot read, we recommend consulting a psychologist. Early diagnosis can allow your child to recieve the accommodations in school that will benefit them greatly.

Note that children on the allism spectrum are unusually vulnerable to mesolexia. If your child is allistic, be sure to watch for these signs.
