Attempting to make a video-game character somewhat inspired by me, as inspired by [responsible-reanimation](http://responsible-reanimation.tumblr.com/tagged/finalbosssona/chrono/).

The first image here is an enemy character that ends the first and/or tutorial level. When attacked, the golden triangles separate and act as a defensive swarm. It can manufacture another triangle if ignored. When it reaches 1 HP, it becomes immune to attacks and disappears in a cloud of ink, which is treated as a victory condition.
