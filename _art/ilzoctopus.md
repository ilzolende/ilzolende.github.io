Attempting to make a video-game character somewhat inspired by me, as inspired by [responsible-reanimation](http://responsible-reanimation.tumblr.com/tagged/finalbosssona/chrono/).

The first image here is an enemy character that ends the first and/or tutorial level. When attacked, the golden triangles separate and act as a defensive swarm. It can manufacture another triangle if ignored. When it reaches 1 HP, it becomes immune to attacks and disappears in a cloud of ink, which is treated as a victory condition.

The second image is a more powerful version of the same character. It repeatedly manufactures defensive triangles. When unshielded, it generates a cloud of ink and reappears in another location with all non-equipment portions at low opacity. It may stab the player characters with the magenta dagger or hurl exploding beads at them as necessary. The dagger and a number of exploding beads are included as loot, and the astute player will complain that the amount of beads in the loot are unrelated to the number expended in the fight. On extreme mode, the character has mimicked cuttlefish attacks with its chromatophores and can very temporarily paralyze the player character. (An early version of this was replaced due to concerns raised regarding epileptic players. The new pattern displayed moves much more slowly.) The coral is scenery.
