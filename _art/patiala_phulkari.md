Tiling patterns based on Indian Phulkari embroidery.

The first is from the Patiala region of India and derived from cloth shown in the file [Patiala Phulkari](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Patiala_Phulkari.jpg), a photo taken by [Indu Singh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Indu_Singh). The second is copied from the pillows at [Lost City](http://lostcityproducts.com/index.php?q=shop-hand-embroidered-pillows-phulkari).
<!-- However, this is an attempt to mimic parts of the pattern shown on the cloth in the photo, and was not created by tracing the photo itself. Although the *photo* is CC BY-SA 3.0, I have no clue who owns the copyright of the *fabric*, and whether or not this image counts as a derivative work of the photo and not just of the fabric. -->
