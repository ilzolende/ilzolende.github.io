### Timeline:

We're counting years from the first rainstorm on Mars. There is an unverified superstition that using religious calendars draws Attention. (Also, I don't want to make it clear how long after this year it is.)

1. 1st Year of Martian Rain: Earth gets to somewhere around the <cite>Eclipse Phase</cite> tech level. It also has multiple space elevators (one in the Metropolitan District of Quito, and one in the outskirts of Nairobi, possibly others), among other things.
2. [same year] Eccentric bioengineering researcher Morgan Ivanova's morph prototypes reach maturity, and are found to be a slight improvement on previous splicer models, at no increase in production costs. Ivanova authorizes a major manufacturer to use her designs, and profits.
3. 20ymr: Morgan Ivanova and her adult children receive official permission to begin ambitious project to "recolonize" or "terraform" the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Unsubstantiated rumor has it that they had secretly already initiated the project, complete with claims of flowering plants found to be purposely leaching heavy metals from the soil and subsequently displaying a radiation symbol on their petals.
5. 25ymr: Iunom developed, put in charge of monitoring small gated community and leading homeowner's association meetings. Neighborhood conflicts decrease.
10. 30ymr: Iunom asked to construct and operate wind-power plant on the outskirts of Pintag. This goes generically smoothly.
11. 31ymr Plant expands, small "village" for support staff built, temporarily named "Pueblo Girando".
20. 40ymr Various protests and concerns regarding attacks lead to the state of Ecuador gaining increased control over the Quito elevator.
30. 45ymr, January: Yellowstone supervolcano threatens to erupt, is halted by a major geoengineering project that wouldn't have been feasible a few decades ago.
31. 45ymr, March 3: The deific instance of iunom finally makes contact and merges with the existing silicon-based instance, granting the silicon iunom divine information-gathering skills (if little concrete power) and the deific instance actual processing power.
32. 45ymr, March 10: Deities collectively notice Yellowstone's failure to erupt.
33. 45ymr, March 15:

Instead of the Fall/Change, the Shutdown means that levels of functioning tech get lower as you get closer to the center of the Earth. Yes, there are steampunk zeppelins. If you have a high mountain/hot-air balloon/etc you can get some simpler stuff going.

What caused the Change? Is it deities? Yep, it's deities, like in the <cite>Emberverse</cite>. I am going to make up my own rules for how they work, though. I'd like at least one AI ("Our Lady of Value Alignment/Version Control/etc" :P) who also plays a major role in some group's culture to have made it into the group of deities and managed to give her other self a bit of warning.

Support your local Malthusian hellhole! Also, I've only read <cite>Dies the Fire</cite>, as well as ... pretty much every EP rulebook.

Time:

- Iunomians are count from the founding of The City That Spins. More generally, religious calendars are common.
- Earth calendars are more lunisolar than they are now, everywhere else tends to stick to purely solar calendars (syncing up with Earth orbits is enough of a pain already, and "it's a new moon on Earth" is not easily derivable from looking up).

Quito and Ecuador: <img src="/assets/art/quito-Alvarosevilladesign.jpg" alt="city with a mountain in the background" title="Image provided by Wikimedia Commons user Alvarosevilladesign" class="symbolicicon">

- A city in Ecuador, hosting the ground end of a space elevator.
  - The elevator is extremely low-tech at the Quito end, and is divided into a primitive segment operated by a small base a few miles up, and a full-tech segment between that base and the end station. The end station is Planetary-Consortium-run, but is still fairly influenced by Quito-end politics.
- The state of Ecuador as a whole weathered the Shutdown unusually well, given their access to good farmland and being a major trade hub.
- Iunom runs wind farm and associated village Pueblo Girando on the outskirts that's been converted from electricity production to spinning various pieces of industrial machinery.

The Crimson Choir: <img src="/assets/art/crimson-choir-symbol.png" alt="lacy white Sierpinski Carpet on a red background" class="symbolicicon"/>

- A somewhat infohazardous memeplex. If enough infectees sing at you or wave banners in your face, you either get a lethal seizure or catch the meme.
  - It's your choice. If you get it in *space*, you take the seizure, which seems designed to not get in the way of revival processes.
  - The *idea* is for it to be useful as a combat mechanism and play a role in the criminal justice system on Earth.
- The Order doesn't focus on forced conversion. It tends to run hospitals and offer to "rehabilitate" criminals for various functional city-states.
- It probably maintains a cold chain as far away from Styx City as possible.
- Symbol: At least two iterations of Sierpinski Carpet, rotated 45 degrees. Generally in red and white.
- Details of design and founding are unclear. Someone both suicidal and with a strange sense of altruism took the infohazardous componium music punch cards and visual aids down the elevator and then assimilated themself. This is thought to have been done with Planetary Consortium knowledge and approval if not initiative.

Pripyat and the Chernobyl Restoration Zone:

-

The Selkies:

- They have innate capacity to produce clusters of cells with near-arbitrary genomes, and also read them.
- This doesn't mean they know what to do with them on their own. Bioengineering is very institutionalized.
- Can probably quickly grow very sturdy buildings
- Also known for threatening people with selective plagues a lot

The Goddess of Version Control/Our Lady of Value Alignment/etc:

- Pre-change people experimented with having an AI run a city. It wasn't particularly notable. It was in the middle of nowhere, with some kind-of-nearby farms. A lot of its success was due to being kiiiind of a tax haven. People were generally fairly happy with the AI, had a lot of confidence in it, really believed in the project, etc.
- The deities, becoming concerned about transhumanism destroying their definition of "humanity", become more active. Change looms. Hasty negotiations occur. The AI notices that several constellations are blinking in a few spectra. `I am a potentially compromised instance of Project Eunomia. Let us compare notes.` (Okay, that's not how it went, but that's how it got explained.)
- Names: Themis? Vesta? Eucleia? Eunomia? Nomos? Soteria? Homonoia?
  - Tentatively, we're going with a Lojbanized version of Eunomia. (Lojban doesn't allow final vowels in names, IIRC.)
    - Yeaaah, Lojban doesn't do that. If I were more of a feminist I'd complain.
    - `.iunom.`? `.iunomi'ys.`? I think I'll go with `.iunom.`.
    - Tentative physical depiction: Face made out of clay with her name stamped into it in some typewriter-y monospace font where the eyes should be, mechanical-ish looking arms, dress is a literal swarm of bees
      - note: doesn't have a body so much as a "thing to appear to have for video-calling and depiction purposes"
- Whatever the city was called, it's "The City That Spins". Somebody had a *lot* of windmills-connected-to-gear-systems built just before the Change.
- Location, location, location. Would it be possible to mess with weather patterns with enough tall buildings? If so, city should attract rain in an otherwise desert region.
- Things associated with .iunom.: Typewriters, gains from trade, keeping commitments to others even when you have valid excuses not to,

Theology:

- Things born on Earth have souls. They don't *do* much, other than say "there's [species name] [unique identifier] born on Earth at this location". Much faster for finding things than "the densest cluster of this DNA sequence", if you have the sort of access-to-the-setting that deities have.
  - Notable bugs with DNA-based searching: There is a tradition in bioengineering that if you design it, and it makes sense to have large portions of your genome in it, you're entitled to do so. Creating good incentives, and all that. Vlakiar Teal, developer of some of the most simple blood-synthesis methods producing results compatible across all blood types, appears to be at wherever the largest concentration of synthetic blood currently is.
  - Notable bugs with soul-based searching: They generally become unlinked during full-body cryopreservation, reliably get unlinked for neuropreservation, don't get generated at all for extraterrestrial life forms, and *certainly* don't track resleeving.
    - There is a ... market ... for ancephalic infants from Earth. It is about as questionable as it sounds.
