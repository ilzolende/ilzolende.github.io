Mesolexia is a neurological disorder afflicting over 95% of Americans.

Those suffering from mesolexia, defined in the DSM-5.0.1 as an inability to read a range of sample texts at 500 WPM or more and subsequently answer comprehension questions, often report having academic, workplace, and social difficulties due to being unable to keep up with their healthy hyperlexic peers at writing-intensive tasks.

The term "mesolexia" is derived from the Greek roots _mesos_, meaning "middle", and _lexis_, which means "speech", but was confused with a root meaning "reading". As _lexis_ was already used to form the terms "dyslexia" and "hyperlexia", correcting this error now would only cause confusion. Those suffering from mesolexia are also known as "mesolexics" or "mesolexic people".
