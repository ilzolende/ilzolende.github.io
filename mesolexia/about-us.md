Cure Mesolexia Now! was founded in September 2015 by Ilzolende Kiefer, friend to many mesolexics. Since then, it has found supporters throughout the rationalsphere, including [Ozy Frantz](https://ozymandias271.tumblr.com/post/140507346513), [promethea Oue](https://socialjusticemunchkin.tumblr.com/post/140510147445), and [Hylleddin](http://hylleddin.tumblr.com/post/140492796722). We are dedicated to researching a cure or preventative measure for mesolexia.

Our mission is to raise public awareness of the harm mesolexia causes, and bring those in search of a cure or preventative measure together. Working together, we hope to create a faster world for current mesolexics.
