Guide to code reuse:

- Lots of this is from the default Jekyll template. That probably means you can reuse those bits, but it might just be easier to get them from the default Jekyll template, unless you literally fork my site.
- I am attempting to ensure the that the `_includes`, `_layouts`, `_sass`, `_css`, `_config.yml`, `_index.html`, and `_feed.xml` directories and files are reusable through editing only `_config.yml` and `_css/main.scss`. My footer text and that sort of thing is not very reusable, but you won't want to use it any way.
  - Be warned! You'll probably want to delete everything with "mesolexia" in its name. It represents an attempt to have two different site layouts on one website.
- `art-collection.html`, `keybase.txt`, `recordings.html`, and `writing.html` are theoretically reusable in their existing form. However, I strongly advise editing them directly.
- The `_art`, `assets`, `_mesolexia`, `_posts`, `_recordings`, and `_writing` directories, as well as the non-HTML text of `about.html`, and the files `favicon.ico`, `mesolexia.md`, and `site-icon.svg`, are my original content. Some of it is derivative work and therefore must be in the Creative Commons, see [the Art page](/art/) for more details. Some of it is derivative work under a less clear license, such as the Princess Urgathoa song and elements of the Ember Phase setting. Some of the SVG patterns are almost certainly not original enough to belong to anyone, myself included. Use your best judgement for reuse, and I'd appreciate being kept in the loop.
  - Note that some color schemes reference the contents of the `assets` directory. Those reference the copyable simple patterns, AFAIK.
